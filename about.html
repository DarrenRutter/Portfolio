        <h2>Hey!</h2>
        <p>I'm Darren.
            <br>
            <br>
        I'm currently working through a Masters of Science in Computer Science at the University of York, a top-20, Russell Group University, in addition to the Front-End
        Career Path on Codecademy. I have learnt HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and I'm currently in the process of learning C#, SQL and NoSQL. I also work full-time for a
        popular pub near where I live with my partner in Kingston-upon-Thames, South-West London.
        <br>
        <br>
        I originally began teaching myself code in the first lockdown of 2020. I realised quickly that I loved creating and designing software, and eventually discovered and
        was accepted onto the Master's course at the University of York. 
        <br>
        <br>
        My Bachelor's Degree is in Hotel Management, which I achieved an Upper Second-Class Honours from the University of Essex. My career in hospitality spans a decade,
        and has enabled me to develop excellent communication and customer service skills.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am ready to seek a new challenge and new opportunities in software development and am building up my portfolio to advertise my skills.
        <br>
        <br>
        I hope you love my work, but I'm always open to constructive criticism and ideas, so please let me know if how I can improve!
    </p>
